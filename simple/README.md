# To update

At the end of a season, update the following:
- `history` for each person: add the new year key and the receiver name value
- `YEARS_THIS_CYCLE`: add the year that just ended so next year will exclude history from this year.
  * IF everyone has gotten everyone else eligible this cycle, reset this list to `[]`
